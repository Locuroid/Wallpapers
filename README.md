# All My Wallpapers
I love a good wallpaper. Here are my favorites. 

## ðŸ“ƒ Credit
I didn't take these pictures, the credit does not belong to me, nor do I possess the skill required to take such photos. I have kept the original filename from when I downloaded the pictures on Unplash to preserve the author name as well as the ID. If you would like to go to the photo page, take the alphanumeric garble after the second "-" and before the "-unsplash" and then slap it onto the end of "https://unsplash.com/photos/".

That may sound complicated so I'll try to elucidate it with an example.
Here is a picture on unsplash: https://unsplash.com/photos/8Q2oyzjDqwY
When downloaded, this is the filename: jonathan-letniak-8Q2oyzjDqwY-unsplash.jpg
Therefore, the photographer is Jonathan Letniak. The alphanumberic garble after the name can be appended to "https://unsplash.com/photos/" in a browser and the image page can be found.

## ðŸ§­ Philosophy
This sounds smart so I'll put it in here.
My desktop has to look *pristine* so I don't leave my recycle bin or any shortcuts there. I also use TaskbarX to make my taskbar centered and transparent. It's a super clean and minimalist look but it would be nothing without a cast of fantastic wallpapers. Unsplash has been my go-to website for awesome wallpapers. I love nature so that's the focus of 99% of my wallpapers, stretching landscapes, beaches, rock formations, as well as a few close up shots of flowers and an occasional cityscape thrown in there to mix it up. I have so many wallpapers because I rotate them every 30 minutes.

## âœ¨ For Best Results
- Get TaskbarX, it makes your taskbar transparent and centers the icons. It's fantastic and works really well. [Download TaskbarX](https://chrisandriessen.nl/taskbarx)
- You can hide your recycling bin like they do in this [Techjunkie Article](https://www.techjunkie.com/remove-recycle-bin-from-windows-10-desktop)
- Rotate the wallpapers so you don't get bored by going to Settings > Personalization > Background > Slideshow. Then choose an album for your slideshow which will be wherever you put the wallpapers you want to rotate. I turn Shuffle "On" and for "Choose a fit," I pick Center.
- Automatically pick an accent color from my background. I really like this setting but Windows selects yellow-brown accent colors for some of the wallpapers so if that's your kryptonite, don't opt for this setting. I personally don't mind it so I have it on.
